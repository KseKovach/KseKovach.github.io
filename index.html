  <p>
	My name is Ksenia Kovach, I am a high school junior and I am taking Wake Tech courses as part of the CCP program. Some of my hobbies include listening to Kpop and heavy metal, working out, 
	reading mystery comics, and playing horror games with my friends. I plan on studying Physics and Computer Science in the future, since I find programming and science fascinating.
